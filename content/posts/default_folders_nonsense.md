summary: Default folders which are provided by modern operating systems are nonsense
---

I have a thought. Default folders which are provided by modern operating systems are nonsense. What are these? On `Windows` we have `My Movies`, `My Pictures`, `My Music` ...etc. Pretty much the same we have on `MacOs` and `Linux` â€” we have `Music`, `Photos`, `Videos` and so on. These types of directories shift the mind of a newcomer to the technological side of view. User starts to think in terms of what media type he deals with and not his problem really is. What if I have some photos from my trip and some text to describe how it was? And maybe a couple of videos? I'm waiting for the OS to just give me a blank home directory so I can organise it however I want. `Blog`, `Code`, `Cooking`, `Porn` and so on. Time of `My %media type%` has gone.
